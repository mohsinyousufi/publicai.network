## Season 1
The first season of the seminar ran from January to March, 2024. We considered different models of public AI, lessons from both history and from AI, general theories of public investment and of regulation, as well as many different arguments for and against public AI. Four themes guided our considerations: public benefit, public accountability, market failure, and political narratives.
