## Season 3
Season 3 ran from April 22 to June 10, 2025, with two special sessions later in the summer. The seminar surveyed positions on AI emerging from art and culture, and considered the relationship between AI and the creative industries through four lenses: political power, cultural power, technological power, and economic power. Several spots were reserved for creative professionals in any medium interested in exploring public AI.

## Season 1

The first season of the seminar ran from January to March, 2024. We considered different models of public AI, lessons from both history and from AI, general theories of public investment and of regulation, as well as many different arguments for and against public AI. Four themes guided our considerations: public benefit, public accountability, market failure, and political narratives.
