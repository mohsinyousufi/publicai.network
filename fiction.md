# Write the story of humanity's future.

## PROMPT:

Submit your original short fiction that helps imagine a **positive future** for humanity and AI -- and **actionable steps** to get us there.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, shaping our experiences of work, relationships, creativity, and community. Financial and environmental resources, policies, and norms are solidifying. Global society has many urgent, critical decisions to make. Compelling narratives and shared visions of the future we want and how to work towards it can help ensure that these decisions are made in ways that benefit us all.

Tech CEOs have the platforms to share their versions of our future AI world. Hollywood and news media dystopias are showing us others. These futures are not inevitable. Now it's time to share your Protopian vision. “Protopian” means an achievable, optimistic future characterized by continuous, incremental progress rather than revolutionary leaps or a static, perfect state. **Protopian stories** imagine a future that is **neither flawless nor catastrophic**, but instead workably better than today. It’s about plausible progress rather than perfection or collapse.

## WHY:
As part of its mission to bring about a movement to support Public AI (AI as public infrastructure that is accountable to and provides benefits for all), the Public AI Network (PAINT) is hosting its first Protopian AI Fiction Prize. PAINT is sponsoring this prize in order to generate fresh narratives and bring more creatives into the global dialogue about the development of AI, and Public AI’s community.

We're looking for short fiction stories that have not previously been published that:
- Incorporate positive visions of an AI-enabled future. 
- Help the public understand how we can shape an AI-based state for the public good. 
- Inspire and empower us all to imagine and create the AI future we want.
- Give us a north star, and ideas for how to move towards it.
- Bring to life the complexities, tradeoffs and paths of action to maximize human flourishing.

There are no restrictions on using AI tools in the development of your submission, but you will be asked to disclose if and how you used them.

**Guiding Questions / Topics**:

Some guiding questions your story may want to address:
- How can we restructure AI development and deployment to serve rather than exploit human creativity?
- How can AI systems support human adaptability and climate resilience rather than enabling surveillance and control?
- What laws, institutions, or incentives are needed to ensure AI is used to augment human capabilities instead of taking away human jobs?
- What new imaginaries, institutions, mechanisms, or processes could enable creating synergies between social, technical, ecological, and legal design of AI systems?
- What needs to happen to give society as a whole, rather than a few powerful players, the deciding voice on what kinds of AI get developed and how they’re used?
